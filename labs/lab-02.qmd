# Data visualization


We will continue working with the `ratings` dataset from the visualization lecture (part of the `languageR` package). It contains the following variables: 

```{r}

str(ratings)

```

1. Fill in the blanks below with one of the following words: `data`, `aesthetics`, `geom`. 

    > The basic ggplot involves: (1) using your `r fitb("data", width = 10)`, (2) defining how variables are mapped to visual properties (`r fitb("aesthetics", width = 10)`), and (3) determining the geometrical object that a plot uses to represent data (`r fitb("geom", width = 10)`)

1. When ggplot2 maps a categorical variable to an aesthetic, it automatically assigns a unique value of the aesthetic to each level of the variable. What is this process called?

    ```{r}
    #| echo: false
    #| results: asis

    # Define the answer choices
    choices <- c(
        "level assignment",
        "variable aestheticization",
        "autofill",
        answer="scaling"
    )

    cat(longmcq(choices))
    ```

1. The code below generated which of the following figures? 

    ```r
    ggplot(
        data = ratings,
        mapping = aes(x = Frequency, y = meanFamiliarity)
    ) + 
        geom_point(mapping = aes(color = Class)) +
        geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
        theme_classic(base_size=20)
    ```

    <!-- ![](/include/figures/global-v-local.png){#fig-globallocal fig-align="center" width=100%} -->


    ```{r}
    #| echo: false
    #| results: asis

    # Define the answer choices
    choices <- c(
        "A",
        answer="B",
        "C"
    )

    cat(longmcq(choices))
    ```

1. Suppose we want to map the variable `Complex` to the color aesthetic in a scatterplot. Which of the following arguments could we pass to `geom_point()`? 

    ```{r}
    #| echo: false
    #| results: asis

    # Define the answer choices
    choices <- c(
        "color = Complex",
        answer="mapping=aes(color = Complex)",
        "color = mapping(Complex)",
        answer="aes(color=Complex)"
    )

    cat(longmcq(choices))
    ```

1. Which geoms are depicted in the following figure? 

    <!-- ![](/include/figures/guess-geom.png){#fig-guessgeom fig-align="center" width=50%} -->

    ```{r}
    #| echo: false
    #| results: asis

    # Define the answer choices
    choices <- c(
        "geom_histogram()",
        answer="geom_density()",
        "geom_bar()",
        "geom_smooth()",
        "geom_point()"
    )

    cat(longmcq(choices))
    ```
